                    Elizabeth Grant (born June 21, 1985), known as Lana Del Rey, is an American singer-songwriter. Her music is noted for its cinematic quality and exploration of tragic romance, glamour, and melancholia, with frequent references to contemporary pop culture and 1950s–70s America. Her vintage Hollywood glamour aesthetic is presented in her music and music videos. She is the recipient of various awards (ex: two Billboard Women in Music, nominations for six Grammy Awards, Golden Globe Award). Variety honored her for being "one of the most influential singer-songwriters of the 21st century". Rolling Stone placed Del Rey on their list of the 200 Greatest Singers of All Time (2023). Times magazine named Del Rey one of the 100 most influential people in 2012.
