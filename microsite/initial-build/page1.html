She is the recipient of various awards (ex: two Billboard Women in Music, nominations for six Grammy Awards, Golden Globe Award). Variety honored her for being "one of the most influential singer-songwriters of the 21st century". Rolling Stone placed Del Rey on their list of the 200 Greatest Singers of All Time (2023).
