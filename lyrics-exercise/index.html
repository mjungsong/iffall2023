            <h1>What Was I Made For - Billie Eilish</h1>
            
            <p>I used to float, now I just fall down</p>
            <p>I used to know but I'm not sure now</p>
            <p>What I was made for? What was I made for?</p>
            <p>Takin' a drive, I was an ideal</p>
            <p>Looked so alive, turns out I'm not real</p>
            <p>Just something you paid for. What was I made for?</p>
            <p>'Cause I, I, I don't know how to feel</p>
            <p>But I wanna try</p>
            <p>I don't know how to feel</p>
            <p>But someday, I might. Someday, I might</p>
            <p>When did it end? All the enjoyment</p>
            <p>I'm sad again, don't tell my boyfriend</p>
            <p>It's not what he's made for. What was I made for?</p>
            <p>'Cause I, 'cause I, I don't know how to feel</p>
            <p>But I wanna try, I don't know how to feel</p>
            <p>But someday I might. Someday I might</p>
            <p>Think I forgot how to be happy</p>
            <p>Something I'm not, but something I can be</p>
            <p>Something I wait for. Something I'm made for</p>
            <p>Something I'm made for</p>
    </body>
