        <div>
            <p>I thought that you'd remember, but it seems that you forgot</p>
            <p>It's hard for me to blame you when you were already lost</p>
            <p>Oh, yeah, I'm tired of always waiting, oh, yeah, yeah</p>
            <p>I see you changed your number, that's why you don't get my calls</p>
            <p>I gave you all of me, now you don't wanna be involved</p>
            <p>Oh, yeah, yeah, I really gotta face it, oh, yeah, yeah</p>
            <p>I just wanna be the one, but to you, we're already done</p>
            <p>Tell me, why'd you have to hit-and-run me?</p>
            <p>Now I'm all alone crying ugly</p>
            <p>You broke my heart just for fun, took my love and just left me numb</p>
            <p>Now it's eight in the morning, hate in the morning</p>
            <p>Another story that's sad and true</p>
            <p>I can feel the pain, can you?</p>
            <p>You had to be the one to let me down, to color me blue</p>
            <p>Hate to see you with someone new, I'll put a curse on her and you</p>
            <p>Ain't no looking back, now you're dead and gone
            <p>My love is gone too
            <p>All my love is gone x3, now you're dead and gone</p>
